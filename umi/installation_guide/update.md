# Update UMI

umi is **not** configured to check for updates automatically when a new version is
available. Updates come in the form of a new installer: they only require you to reinstall
using the new `msi` installer:

- Download the latest version of umi
  [here](https://umireleases.blob.core.windows.net/latest-release/UMI.msi)
- Consult the changelog
  [here](https://umireleases.blob.core.windows.net/latest-release/CHANGELOG.txt)
