# Install using the `msi` installer

The
[umi installer](https://umireleases.blob.core.windows.net/latest-release/UMI.msi) is the
recommended tool to install umi. Use it to install and maintain umi on different versions
of Rhino, and easily remove umi.


<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

1. [Download the installer](https://umireleases.blob.core.windows.net/latest-release/UMI.msi)
   **.msi**.

   In Chrome, it is possible that the file will be blocked. Simply click on `...` and
   select "Keep".

   could harm your device")

   If
   [Microsoft Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10)
   is activated on your computer, the following window could also appear:

   ![harm](/umiverse-docs/assets/images/harm.png "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen")

   To dismiss, click on "Show more" and then click on "Keep anyway". This will allow you
   to run the msi installer.

2. Run the installer and follow the wizard steps.

When you run Rhino for the first time after the install, Rhino will check for
compatibility of the plugin.
