# UBEM.io

The key intent of
[UBEM.io](http://www.ubem.io) is to receive an input geometric file defining the urban
building context of interest, and output an umi for Rhino file for simulations and
scenario analysis in UMI for Rhino. Within UBEM.io, users will be able to segment/group
the building stock into desired archetypes, and assign relevant building simulation
templates from our database/library. The assigned building templates will be reflected in
the umi file automatically, eliminating the need for manual assignments. Umi allows
various urban-scale simulations, including energy and daylighting.
